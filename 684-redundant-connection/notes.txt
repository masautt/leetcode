Definitions

1. Map : Better Key-value store than js obj
    Allows any type to be the Key (not just string)
    Preserves key insertion order 
        { for (const [key, value] of myMap) console.log(key, value)}
    Faster lookups
    Possibly faster deletes
        Some js engines might restructure the object in mem after deletion

2. Set : Better Array with unique values and quick lookups 
    Prevents duplciates automatically 
        mySet.add(1); mySet.add(1); mySet.size --> 1 not 2
    Faster lookups
        mySet.has(10) --> O(1)
        myArray.includes(10) --> O(n)
    Faster deletion 
        mySet.delete(10) --> O(1)
        mySet.splice() --> O(n)


3. Graph : Represent relationships between entities using nodes and edges
    private adjacencyList: Map<T, Set<T>>;

4. adjacencyList : each key points to a collection of adjacent nodes
