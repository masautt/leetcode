index.ts is the final solution based on neetcode's video

index3.ts was my first try. I was missing the check I later found in his video to verify that prices[l] < prices[r]

This makes sense because we only want to consider new solutions when we can sell higher (r) than the buying prices (l)

index2.ts was one step closer but I had the same mistake he outlined in the video. My solution with the default example passed but 

When we had someone that [0, 9] at the end it failed because l did not know how to jump to r when a new profit came about

This exmplains the else { l = r }
