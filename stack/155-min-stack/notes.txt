So this one I actually finished today (11/22) b/c I'm less stressed today

This totally makes sense storing two values for each

It's like saving this history in the stack, I kinda get what this is for

Also the only major enhancement I made between the two was using Math.min
I kinda forgot I can do that. Probably because I don't use math libraries often

[val, min]

push(0);

[0, 0]

push(-1);

[-1, -1]
[0, 0]

push(2)

[2, -1]
[-1, -1]
[0, 0]

pop()

[-1, -1]
[0, 0]
