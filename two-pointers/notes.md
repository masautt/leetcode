"two pointers" sounds scary but its just having two indexes to traverse an array

For example the palindrome problem just has us delcare a pointer at the beginning

and end of an array. We traverse by increment the left and decrementing the right.

I'm not sure why sliding window is separated from this.

Typically o(n) because we are traversing the array.
