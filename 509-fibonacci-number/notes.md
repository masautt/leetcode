The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each is a sum of the two
previous numbers. Usually starting with 0 and 1

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 21...
1 = 0 + 1
2 = 1 + 1
3 = 1 + 2
5 = 2 + 3

The equation for Fibonacci sequence is : 
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) 
As we can see, this involves recursion

This problem was also suggested to me by a recruiter but I couldn't find it in neetcode.
I asked ChatGPT and it suggested out of the possible categories that it belongs in 1-D DP.

This is a 1 dimensional dynamic programming problem because it does not involve a 2 dimensional array.

Dynamic programming does not necessarily need to involve recursion. Dynamic programming isn't always
required either. It's just something that helps with time and space complexity.

-Time Complexity : Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run
-Space Complexity : Measures the amount of memory space an algorithm uses
