So this one was rather interesting. I was thinking that I would need to build

two sets that represent the strings like two objects and just compare them

but now seeing the answer I see I can just build the object with the first string
and tear down the object with the second

If the result is back to zero then we know

Also I saw that I was doing it with a hashTable and then a map but in reality I just need an object
